# The Data Stack
################

# `inla.stack` is useful for organziing data, covariates, indices, and projector matrices.
# Helps control the way effects are projected in the linear predictor

# This function allows us to work with predictors that includes terms with different dimentions
# 3 main agruments are a vector list with the data, list of projector matrices, and list of effects, and a label (i.e. tag)

stk5 <- inla.stack(
    data = list(resp = SPDEtoy$y),
    A = list(A5, 1), # list of the projector matrix and a 1 (need to add the 1)
    effects = list(i = 1:spde5$n.spde, # This is another index. This can also be defined with inla.spde.make.index
                   beta0 = rep(1, nrow(SPDEtoy))),
    tag = 'est'

# and it generates a new and simplified matrix

###########################
# Model Fitting and Results
###########################

# To fit the model, the intercept in the formula must be removed and added as a covariate term in the list of
#  effects, so that all the covariate terms in the formula can be included in a projector matrix.
#  Then, the matrix of predictors is passed to the inla() function in its control.predictor argument, as follows:

res5 <- inla(resp ~ 0 + beta0 + f(i, model = spde5), #intercept (beta0) and the spatial random field (i)
             data = inla.stack.data(stk5),
             control.predictor = list(A = inla.stack.A(stk5)))

# inla function returns a object with several results:
# summaries, marginal posterior densities for each paramter,
# regression parameters, latent fields and all hyperparamters

# summary of the intercept (beta0):
res5$summary.fixed

# Similarly, the summary of the precision of the Gaussian likelihood
res5$summary.hyperpar[1,]

# *more on looking at the marginal distributions*

# Projection of the random field
################################

# A common objective when dealing with spatial data collected at some locations is
# the prediction on a fine grid of the spatial model to get high resolution maps. 
# In this section we show how to do this prediction for the random field term only.

#Here we will predict at 3 locations: (0.1, 0.1), (0.5, 0.55), (0.7, 0.9)

###---Chapter 4 Point processess and preferential sampling---###

# point pattern records the occurence of events in a study region - these locations of the observed events depend on an underlying spatial process which is often modeled using an intensity function (lambda(s))
# lambda(s) - measures the average # of events per unit of space and it can be modeled to depend on covariates and other effects

# Modeling this point process is known as a log-gaussian Cox process (LGCP). 
# A Cox process is just a name for a Poisson process with vary intensity (think about dividing the study region into cells and counting the number of points in each one and modeling that)

# LGCP definition - The Cox process is a Poisson process with intensity (lambda(s)) that varies over space. Given some area (A - think about a grid cell), the probability of observing a certain number of points in that area follows a Poisson distribution with intensity (expected value)


###---Data Simulation---###

library(spatstat) # using rLGCP() function to sample from a log-cox point process
win <- owin(c(0,3),c(0,3)) # use a (0,3) x (0,3) simulation window
win


npix <- 300 # resolution of the grid
spatstat.options(npixel = npix)

# Modeling intensity as: log( lambda(s) ) = beta0 + S(s)
# beta0 is a fixed value and S(s) is a Gaussian spatial process with MatÃ©rn covariance and zero mean
# Parameter beta0 can be regarded as a global mean level for the log intensity; i.e. the log-intensity fluctuates about it according to the spatial process S(s)
# IF NO SPATIAL FIELD, the expected number of points is e^beta0 times the are of the window. Thus the expected number of points is:
beta0 <- 3
exp(beta0) * diff(range(win$xrange)) * diff(range(win$yrange)) #expected number


# We will use a Matern covariance function with nu = 1 (not sure what nu is!). The other parameters are the variance (sigma2x) and the scale (range)
# (look at the text to see why these values were chosen - TLDR will produce a smooth changes)
sigma2x <- 0.2 
range <- 1.2
nu <- 1

# The coordinates of the observed events of the point pattern can be obtained
xy <- cbind(lg.s$x, lg.s$y)[, 2:1]

n <- nrow(xy)

###---Inference---###

# The augmented data set is made of a binary response, with 1 for the observed points and 0 for some dummy observations. Both the observed and dummy observations will have associated âexpected valuesâ or weights that will be included in the Poisson regression

# Building the mesh
# For point process we dont ususally use the locations points as mesh nodes. We will use the loc.docmain agrument to build the mesh.

  # PC-prior on sigma: P(sigma > 1) = 0.01
  prior.sigma = c(1, 0.01)) 

# create integration stack
# The SPDE approach for point pattern analysis defines the model at the nodes of the mesh. To fit the log-Cox point process model, these points are considered as integration points.
# The expected number of events is proportional to the area around the node (the areas of the polygons in the dual mesh). This means that at the nodes of the mesh with larger triangles, there are also larger expected values.

dmesh <- book.mesh.dual(mesh) # making a dual mesh

# converting the polygons into a `SpatialPolygons`
domain.polys <- Polygons(list(Polygon(loc.d)), '0')

# since the mesh is larger than the study area, we need to compute the interaction between each polygon in the dual mesh and the study area

  else return(0)
})

# sum of the weights is the area of the study region
sum(w)

# checking how many integration points have zero weight
table(w > 0)

##--Data and projection matrices--##

# The vector of weights computed above (w) is what we need to used as the exposure (E) in the poisson likelihood in INLA
# We will make another vector of 1's (representing the observations) with a sequence of 0's (representing the mesh nodes)
y.pp <- rep(0:1, c(nv, n)) #nv was the number of nodes in mesh, n is the number of locations

# The exposure vecotr can be defined as:
e.pp <- c(w, rep(0, n)) #makes a vector that combines the weights with a sequence of 0's (the number of observations)

# Next we create the projection matrix. This takes two steps:
# 1) For the integration points this is just a diagonal because these locations are just the mesh vertices
imat <- Diagonal(nv, rep(1, nv))

# 2) For the observed points, another projection matrix is defined:
lmat <- inla.spde.make.A(mesh, xy)

# Then the entire projection matrix is:
A.pp <- rbind(imat, lmat)

# Now we can set up the data stack
stk.pp <- inla.stack(
  data = list(y = y.pp, e = e.pp),
  A = list(1, A.pp), # the 1 is for the intercept (b0). Since I put that first in A, the intercept needs to be first in the effects
  effects = list(
    list(b0 = rep(1, nv + n)),
    list(i = 1:spde$n.spde)
    ),
  tag = "pp"
)


##--Posterior Marginals--##

# Here we will fit the model to get the posterior marginals for all the parameters
